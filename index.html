  <h1>Hello<h1>
	
</body>
	  My name is Joe Boryszewski. I currently am a student at the University at Buffalo. I am currently undeclared for a major, but interested in Biology. 
	  Some of my favorite hobbies are playing video games, watching movies, hanging out with friends, and learning. Although I like learning I am not a huge
	  fan of school. I am excited to spend time at this university and hopefully find a career.
